# Enlarge your Backbone project

A talk on how to organize the architecture of your growing Backbone application, based on the experience of [Nicolas Carlo](http://twitter.com/nicoespeon) & [Fabien Bernard](http://twitter.com/fabien0102) developing [the Vinoga game](http://vinoga.com).

# Few notes here

This talk was built in French (for now), at the occasion of [Backbone.js Meetup #2](http://www.meetup.com/backbone-paris/events/189771252/?_af_eid=189771252&a=uc1_te&_af=event) hold in Paris.

The presentation was built upon the amazing [reveal.js](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/).
